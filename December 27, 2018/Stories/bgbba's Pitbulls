bgbba's Pitbulls
By HenryDraton

On December 26, 2018 bgbba decided to post a picture of a large male pitbull standing behind a smaller puppy to the Civclassic subreddit. It was immediately downvoted to high hell, due to various reasons that shall become clear. This story is not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. In the post, the big dog was labeled "Reiko" and the little pup was labeled "Thomas." The big dog had an enormous erect penis that bgbba only partially censored with a small black box. The post seemed to be implying numerous things, and spawned multiple posts ridiculing bgbba for having made the damned thing in the first place. Why can't the Main Conductor of Yoahtl simply not post pictures of extremely inappropriate dogs to the subreddit? Why does he have to post pictures of these things with the genitallia barely censored? I get the reference to big dogs and little pups, but I do not like the fact that I now have to look at a picture of a dog with its penis barely censored every time I look at the subreddit. This is quite an unfortunate series of events in which the picture now lives in my head rent free. I do not like this and wish it to stop.
